## About Me

I am a Master of Science in Biostatistics graduate at California State University with experience in data analysis, statistical modeling, and programming. As a 
research data analyst at the University of California, San Francisco, I analyzed National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) data and modeled the effect of improving diet on systolic blood pressure in the population 
of US adults aged 35-94. I am eager to apply my skills and experience to make meaningful contributions in a dynamic and innovative field.






## Projects/Capstone Experiences 

**Survival Analysis of Covariates Implicating Time to Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplant Recipients with 
Leukemia in the Clinical Setting**
- Investigated factors affecting the time to chronic graft-versus-host disease (CGVHD) in leukemia patients who received
allogeneic bone marrow transplants. I examined clinical characteristics across different sites.


**Forecasting Wins and Losses with Machine Learning**
- Forecasted 82-game wins and losses scores with linear discriminant analysis trained on 73- game regular season data from
the 2019-2020 season using games played, team score, and opponent score as predictors.


**Multiple Linear Regression of the 2021-2022 Lakers Regular Season** 
- Developed a linear model using R to predict points per game performance during the 82-game regular season 
with a 21 by 23 dimensioned dataset from basketball-reference and nba.com, where 86% of the variation in the 
data is explained by the model.


**Tall People and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease**
- Analyzed 68,783 by 12-dimension Kaggle clinic dataset for relationship between height and risk of CVD; given 
the data, I found that the probability of having CVD given you are tall is 0.47.
