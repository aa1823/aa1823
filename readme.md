## Welcome!

üî¨ **Who I Am**: I am a scientist that wears many hats. By training, I'm a Biostatistician with a Master's degree from California State University, but I also have a background in data analytics and data science. My journey in data analysis and statistical programming has been driven by a long-standing deep interest in public health epidemiology. 

üìä **My Experience**: Previously, I've done modeling work to learn about the impact of diet on cardiovascular disease in US adults. My current focus: working with my lab to analyze the impact of certain xenobiotics on bronchopulmonary displasia in infants.

üåü **My Goal**: My current goal is to improve and expand my statistical knowledge and skillset to better answer unsolved questions in the public healtha arena. I hope to one day give back and make great contributions to the field of biostatistics that may one day have a great impact on people's public health. 

## Highlighted Projects

### üß¨ Survival Analysis: Unraveling Factors in Post-Transplant Disease
[Paper](https://github.com/aa1823/survGVHD/blob/main/Azuka_Atum_Final_Project_Stat697%20(1).pdf) | [Repository](https://github.com/aa1823/survGVHD)
- Objective: To identify factors influencing chronic graft-versus-host disease onset in allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients across 4 different clinical sites: The Ohio State University Hospitals, Hahnemann in Philadephia, St. Vincent's Hospital in Sydney, Australia, and Alfred Hospital in Melbourne. 
- Analysis/Tools: Survival analysis techniques in SAS: Kaplan-Meier, AFT modeling.
- Outcome: Uncovered disparities in CGVHD onset across different demographics and clinical sites; St. Vincent patients experiencing a 35% longer time to CGVHD and Alfred patients experiencing a 10.3% shorter time.
