## About Me 

I am a Master of Science in Biostatistics graduate at California State University with experience in data analysis, statistical modeling, and programming using R and SAS. As a research data analyst at the University of California, San Francisco, I analyzed National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data and modeled the effect of improving diet on systolic blood pressure in the population of US adults aged 35-94. I am eager to apply my skills and experience to make meaningful contributions in a dynamic and innovative field.

 ü©∫ **Survival Analysis of Covariates Implicating Time to Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease in Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplant Recipients with Leukemia in the Clinical Setting**

[Paper](https://github.com/aa1823/survGVHD/blob/main/Azuka_Atum_Final_Project_Stat697%20(1).pdf) | [Repository](https://github.com/aa1823/survGVHD)

- Investigated factors affecting the time to chronic graft-versus-host disease (CGVHD) in leukemia patients who received
allogeneic bone marrow transplants. I conducted comprehensive survival analysis on leukemia patients post-transplant to determine time to chronic graft-versus-host disease (CGVHD) across four (4) clinical sites using Kaplan-Meier and gamma AFT models in SAS: found a 35% longer CGVHD onset time for St. Vincent patients, 10.3% shorter for Alfred Hospital, and a 20.4% reduced risk for Ohio State University patients; additionally, male patients had a 14% longer onset time, with each year of age increasing CGVHD onset by 0.3%.


 üèÄ **Forecasting Wins and Losses with Machine Learning**

- Forecasted 82-game wins and losses scores with linear discriminant analysis trained on 73- game regular season data from
the 2019-2020 season using games played, team score, and opponent score as predictors. From the simulation, I was able to conclude that had the Lakers played all 82 games, they would have won 55 games, and lost 27, with a final win percentage of 67% and a loss percentage of 33%.


 ‚õπüèæ Ô∏è**Multiple Linear Regression of the 2021-2022 Lakers Regular Season**

- Developed a linear model using R to predict points per game performance during the 82-game regular season 
with a 21 by 23 dimensioned dataset from basketball-reference and nba.com, where 86% of the variation in the 
data is explained by the model.


 ü´Ä **Tall People and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease**

[Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U9NtZCW5T2i48sWn1qJxMcVl-fOO05FN8F-vDAGjSWg/edit?usp=sharing) | [Repository](https://github.com/aa1823/cvdheight)

- Analyzed 68,783 by 12-dimension Kaggle clinic dataset for relationship between height and risk of CVD; given 
the data, I found that the probability of having CVD given you are tall is 0.47.
