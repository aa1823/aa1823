## Welcome to My Profile!

üî¨ **Who I Am**: I'm a dedicated Biostatistician with a Master's degree from California State University. My journey in data analysis and statistical modeling has been driven by a deep passion for uncovering insights in health data. Specializing in R and SAS, I thrive on transforming complex datasets into meaningful stories.

üìä **My Experience**: At the University of California, San Francisco, as a research data analyst, I delved into the intricacies of the NHANES dataset. My focus: unveiling how dietary improvements impact systolic blood pressure among US adults. This project not only honed my analytical skills but also reinforced my commitment to public health research.

üåü **My Goal**: I am on a quest to apply my expertise in dynamic, innovative environments, aiming to make substantial contributions to the field of biostatistics and beyond.
