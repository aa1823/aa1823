## Welcome!

🔬 **Who Am I?**: I am a scientist that wears many hats. By training, I'm a Biostatistician with a Master's degree from California State University, but I also have a background in data analytics and data science. My journey in data analysis and statistical programming has been driven by a long-standing deep interest in public health epidemiology. 

📊 **My Experience**: Previously, I've done modeling work to learn about the impact of diet on cardiovascular disease in US adults. My current focus: working with my lab to analyze the impact of certain xenobiotics on bronchopulmonary displasia in infants. 

🌟 **My Goal**: My current goal is to improve and expand my statistical knowledge and skillset to better answer unsolved questions in the public health arena. I hope to one day give back and make great contributions to the field of biostatistics in a way that has a massive positive impact on people's health from all walks of life--whether locally or globally. 

❤️‍🔥 **My Hobbies**: In my free time I like to learn new things, meditate, read, write, and analyze sports data. My current passion projects include: learning Python, studying African history, making art, and indoor-gardening. 


## Highlighted Projects 

#These are some of the projects that I've completed over the course of my degree. 

### 🧬 Survival Analysis: Unraveling Factors in Post-Transplant Disease
[Paper](https://github.com/aa1823/survGVHD/blob/main/Azuka_Atum_Final_Project_Stat697%20(1).pdf) | [Repository](https://github.com/aa1823/survGVHD)
- Objective: To identify factors influencing chronic graft-versus-host disease onset in allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients across 4 different clinical sites: The Ohio State University Hospitals, Hahnemann in Philadephia, St. Vincent's Hospital in Sydney, Australia, and Alfred Hospital in Melbourne. 
- Analysis/Tools: Survival analysis techniques in SAS: Kaplan-Meier, AFT modeling.
- Outcome: Uncovered disparities in CGVHD onset across different demographics and clinical sites; St. Vincent patients experiencing a 35% longer time to CGVHD and Alfred patients experiencing a 10.3% shorter time. 

### 🏀 Forecasting Wins and Losses with Machine Learning
[Presentation](https://aa1823.netlify.app/projects/forecasting-wins-and-losses-with-machine-learning/atumazuka_stat694_project#/title-slide) | [Repository](https://github.com/aa1823/Forecasting-Wins-and-Losses-with-Machine-Learning)
- Focus: Forecasting the full-season performance of NBA teams using mid-season data.
- Analysis/Tools: Applied linear discriminant analysis to predict win-loss records.
- Outcome: Accurately projected the Los Angeles Lakers' performance for the 2019-2020 season.

### ⛹🏾 ️ Regression Analysis of the Lakers' Regulas Season
[Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10IYbtPEVv5NWqgOiy5cJY6PBJQrxdg0OaxwHcHkatOw/edit?usp=sharing) | [Repository](https://github.com/aa1823/MLRLakers2122)
- Focus: Developing a predictive model for the Lakers' points per game.
- Analysis: Multiple linear regression in R.
- Outcome: Model explained 86% of the variance in the team's performance.

### 🫀 Tall People and Risk of Cardiovascular Disease
[Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U9NtZCW5T2i48sWn1qJxMcVl-fOO05FN8F-vDAGjSWg/edit?usp=sharing) | [Repository](https://github.com/aa1823/cvdheight)
- Focus: Investigating the correlation between height and cardiovascular disease.
- Analysis: Examined a large dataset from Kaggle.
- Outcome: Identified a 47% probability of CVD in taller individuals.

### 🫘 Fixed-Effect Analysis of Baseline Serum Creatinine across sex and blood pressure levels
[Presentation](https://github.com/aa1823/CKDproj/blob/main/Fixed-Effect%20Analysis%20of%20Baseline%20Serum%20Creatinine%20across%20sex%20and%20blood%20pressure%20levels%20.pdf) |
[Repository](https://github.com/aa1823/CKDproj)
- Focus: Is there an observable difference in baseline creatinine levels and blood pressure between sexes.
- Analysis: Examined a kaggle dataset of electronic medical records of 491 patients from Tawam hospital in Al-Ain city in the United Arab Emirates in 2008 using SAS. 
- Outcome: There is a difference in baseline creatinine across sexes, and it is statistically significant. On average, women were over 20 µmol/L lower compared to men in the dataset. There was no effect of blood pressure on serum creatinine.
