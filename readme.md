## Welcome!

üî¨ **Who I Am**: Biostatistician with a Master's degree from California State University. My journey in data analysis and statistical modeling has been driven by a deep passion for uncovering insights in health data. Specializing in R and SAS, I thrive on transforming complex datasets into meaningful stories.

üìä **My Experience**: At the University of California, San Francisco, as a research data analyst, I delved into the intricacies of the NHANES dataset. My focus: unveiling how dietary improvements impact systolic blood pressure among US adults. This project not only honed my analytical skills but also reinforced my commitment to public health research.

üåü **My Goal**: I am on a quest to apply my expertise in dynamic, innovative environments, aiming to make substantial contributions to the field of biostatistics and beyond.

## Highlighted Projects

### üß¨ Survival Analysis: Unraveling Factors in Post-Transplant Disease
- [Paper](https://github.com/aa1823/survGVHD/blob/main/Azuka_Atum_Final_Project_Stat697%20(1).pdf) | [Repository](https://github.com/aa1823/survGVHD)
- Objective: To identify factors influencing chronic graft-versus-host disease onset in allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients across 4 different clinical sites: The Ohio State University Hospitals, Hahnemann in Philadephia, St. Vincent's Hospital in Sydney, Australia, and Alfred Hospital in Melbourne. 
- Analysis/Tools: Survival analysis techniques in SAS: Kaplan-Meier, AFT modeling.
- Outcome: Uncovered disparities in CGVHD onset across different demographics and clinical sites; St. Vincent patients experiencing a 35% longer time to CGVHD and Alfred patients experiencing a 10.3% shorter time.
